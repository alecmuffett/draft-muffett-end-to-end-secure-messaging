<t>This document
defines End-to-End Secure Messaging
in terms of the behaviours
that <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be exhibited
by software
which claims to implement it,
or which claims to implement
that subset which is known as
End-to-End Encrypted Messaging.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>End-to-End Secure Messaging (E2ESM)
is a mechanism
which offers a digital analogue
of &quot;closed distribution lists&quot;
for sharing message content
amongst a set of participants,
where all participants
are visible to each other
and where non-participants
are excluded
from access to message content.</t>
<t>In client-server network models
it is common to implement E2ESM
by means of encryption,
in order to obscure
content at rest
upon a central server.
So therefore E2ESM
is often
narrowly regarded
in terms of &quot;end-to-end encryption&quot;.</t>
<t>Other architectural approaches exist -
for instance <xref target="RicochetRefresh"></xref>
which implements
closed distribution
by using
secure point-to-point <xref target="RFC7686"></xref> networking
to literally restrict
the distribution
of plaintext content
to relevant participants.</t>
<t>Therefore we describe E2ESM
in terms of
functional outcomes
of the messenger
rather than
in terms
of implementation
goals and technologies.</t>

<t>Software which functions

<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> satisfy the following principles, and
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> satisfy these principles in respect of the provided definitions
for all forms of communication
and data-sharing
that the software offers,
otherwise it is not
an End-to-End Secure Messenger.</t>

each which are composed
of &quot;plaintext content and sensitive metadata&quot; (PCASM)
and which constitute
a &quot;conversation&quot;
amongst a set of &quot;participants&quot;,
to provide E2ESM
will require:</t>

<t>The PCASM
of any given message
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only be available
to the fixed set

and at the time when
it was sent.</t>

<section anchor="non-participation"><name>Non-Participation</name>
<t>It follows that
for any given message,
all entities
that exist

<t>These principles
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be measured
with respect to
the following definitions:</t>

<section anchor="participant"><name>Participant</name>
<t>A participant
is any entity -
human, machine, software bot, escrow agent, or otherwise,
that is bounded
by the extent
of that entity's
<xref target="TrustedComputingBase"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="conversation"><name>Conversation</name>
<t>A conversation
is a sequence
of one or more messages
over a period of time
amongst a constant or evolving
set of participants.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="plaintext-content-and-sensitive-metadata-pcasm"><name>Plaintext Content and Sensitive Metadata (PCASM)</name>
<t>The PCASM
of a message
is defined as:
1 or more
bits of information
regarding any or all of:</t>

<ol>
<li>the plaintext message content (the &quot;content&quot;)</li>
<li>the precise size of the content</li>
<li>any metadata which may describe the thematic nature of the content</li>
</ol>

<section anchor="examples-of-pcasm"><name>Examples of PCASM</name>
<t>Information which would be PCASM would include, non-exclusively:</t>

<ol>
<li>The content is &quot;Hello, world.&quot;</li>
<li>The content is definitely 13 bytes long</li>
<li>The content starts with the word &quot;Hello&quot;</li>
<li>The content contains the substring &quot;ello&quot;</li>
<li>The content does not contain the word &quot;Goodbye&quot;</li>
<li>The content contains a substring from amongst the following set: ...</li>
<li>The content does not contain a substring from amongst the following set: ...</li>
<li>The top bit of the first byte of the content in ASCII encoding, is zero</li>
<li>The MD5 hash of the content is 080aef839b95facf73ec599375e92d47</li>
<li>The hash of the content exists amongst the following set of hashes: ...</li>
<li>The hash of the content does not exist amongst the following set of hashes: ...</li>
<li>The content was matched by a machine-learning classifier with the following training set: ...</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section anchor="examples-of-non-pcasm"><name>Examples of non-PCASM</name>
<t>Information which would not be PCASM would include, non-exclusively:</t>

<ol>
<li>The content is sent from Alice</li>
<li>The content is sent to Bob</li>
<li>The content is between 1 and 16 bytes long</li>
<li>The content was sent at the following date and time: ...</li>
<li>The content was sent from the following IP address: ...</li>
<li>The content was sent from the following geolocation: ...</li>
<li>The content was composed using the following platform: ...</li>
</ol>
<t>There is obvious discussion
to be had
regarding
&quot;how fuzzy a content-size is fuzzy enough?&quot;</t>
<t>If the size of a message's content
is at all observable
by a non-participant,
it would appear reasonable
where a block cipher is used to implement E2ESM,
to avoid visibly surfacing
the underlying content size
as a number
that is any more specific or precise
than an integer multiple
of the underlying cipher block size would be.</t>
<t>Stream cipher &quot;fuzziness&quot; adequacy
is currently undefined in this draft.</t>

<section anchor="backdoor"><name>Backdoor</name>
<t>Discussions of E2ESM
frequently reference
the concept of &quot;backdoors&quot;.
We propose a standard definition:</t>
<t>A backdoor
is any
intentional or unintentional mechanism,
in respect of a given message
and that message's set of participants
where some PCASM
of that message
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> become available
to a non-participant
without the intentional action of a participant.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="scope-of-a-participant-in-e2esm"><name>Scope of a Participant in E2ESM</name>
<t>The term &quot;participant&quot;
in this document
exists to supercede
the more vague notion of &quot;end&quot;
in the phrase &quot;end-to-end&quot;.</t>
<t>Participants are defined
in terms of an entity's <xref target="TrustedComputingBase"></xref>
to acknowledge
that an entity
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> legitimately
store, forward, or access messages
by means
that are outside of
the messenger software.</t>
<t>For example:
if a participant
accesses their E2ESM messenger
via remote desktop software,
and their RDP session is hijacked by a third party;
of if they back-up their messages
in cleartext
to cloud storage
leading somehow to data exfiltration,
neither of these
would be a failure of E2ESM.</t>
<t>This would be
a failure of
the participant's
<xref target="TrustedComputingBase"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="rationale"><name>Rationale</name>
<t>Consider FooBook,
a company
which provides
messaging services
for conversations
between entities
who use it.</t>
<t>For each conversation
FooBook <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> decide
whether to represent itself
as a conversation participant
or as a non-participant. (Transparency of Participation)</t>
<t>If FooBook decides
to represent itself
as a non-participant,
then it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
have any access to PCASM. (Integrity of Participation / Non-Participation)</t>
<t>If FooBook decides
to represent itself
as a participant,
then it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
have privileged access
to PCASM,
for instance
via direct database access,
but it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
have &quot;normal&quot; access
to PCASM
of conversations
where it is a participant. (Integrity of Participation, Equality of Participation)</t>
<t>FooBook <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
retain means
to eject reported abusive participants
from a conversation. (Decrease in Closure of Participation)</t>
<t>FooBook <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
retain means
to forcibly insert
new participants
into a conversation.
For clarity:
this specification
does not recognise
any notion
of &quot;atomic&quot; exchange
of one particpant with another,
treating it as an ejection,
followed by an &quot;illegitimate&quot; insertion.
(Increase in Closure of Participation)</t>
<t>FooBook <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
enable the user
to observe and manage
the complete state
of their <xref target="TrustedComputingBase"></xref>
with respect
to their FooBook messaging services. (Management and Visibility)</t>

<section anchor="is-it-not-necessary-for-e2esm-to-offer-digital-rights-management"><name>Is it not necessary for E2ESM to offer Digital Rights Management</name>
<t>Integrity of Participation,
which restricts access
of a message's PCASM
to its fixed set of participants,
obviously does not apply
to content
that is copied as
a &quot;fresh string of bits&quot;
and resubmitted
by a participant
sent as a new message
to a new, &quot;current&quot; set of participants.</t>
<t>Less obviously
an E2ESM solution
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> enable
message &quot;forwarding&quot;,
or &quot;replying&quot;,
or &quot;quoting&quot;,
where a participant
may freshly send
older object references and keys
that permit &quot;current&quot; participants
to access PCASM
from which
they were previously excluded.</t>
<t>Per the definition
of &quot;backdoor&quot;
this is considered
application functionality
requiring &quot;intentional action&quot;
of a message's participant -
nearly equivalent to
forwarding the content
as a &quot;fresh string of bits&quot;.</t>
<t>Both approaches -
analogous to &quot;call by value&quot;
versus &quot;call by reference&quot; -
raise interesting
application design questions.
However
such features
exist outside
of the scope
of this definition.</t>
