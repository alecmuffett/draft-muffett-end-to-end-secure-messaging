   A 'Duck Test' for End-to-End Secure, Encrypted Messenger Software
              draft-muffett-end-to-end-secure-messaging-04

Abstract

   This internet-draft describes a test which MAY be used, either singly
   or in association with further tests, to establish whether end-to-end
   secure, encrypted messenger software correctly exhibits behaviours
   that are commonly associated with those and related descriptions of
   messenger software.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Why CFRG?

   The IRTF CFRG charter says:

   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-irtf-cfrg/01/
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-irtf-cfrg/01/)

   "The CFRG serves as a bridge between theory and practice, bringing
   new cryptographic techniques to the Internet community and promoting
   an understanding of the use and applicability of these mechanisms via
   Informational RFCs ... Our goal is to provide a forum for discussing
   and analyzing general cryptographic aspects of security protocols,
   and to offer guidance on the use of emerging mechanisms and new uses
   of existing mechanisms."

   This internet-draft proposes an informational RFC which assists the
   discussion and analysis of the general cryptographic aspects of end-
   to-end secure, encrypted messenger software, providing guidance on
   the use - especially choice - of such software.

   Hence this internet-draft is submitted to CFRG.

1.2.  Why a 'Duck Test'?

   There are efforts afoot to help a user determine whether some
   software 'looks' like end-to-end secure, encrypted messenger
   software.  Such determinations may require considerable information,
   discussion of nuance, and application of considerable judgement.

   By contrast, this internet-draft specifies a simple 'falsifiability'
   test using which a person may establish whether some software does
   not 'quack' in the way that end-to-end secure, encrypted messenger
   software is commonly expected.

   The described test is not intended to be complete; additional tests,
   checks and obligations may be brought to bear by people who wish to
   determine whether some software also offers other characteristics
   such as 'anonymity', or broader forms of 'metadata privacy'.

   If some software fails to satisfy the duck test, it will be deemed
   only to have failed the duck test, and nothing more excepting that by
   failing the duck test we can clearly state that the software fails to
   exhibit some commonly expected characteristics of end-to-end secure,
   encrypted messenger software.

1.3.  Why only 'Messenger Software'?

   This internet-draft is written for the test to be applied to end-to-
   end secure, encrypted messenger software.  It may be that the
   concepts describe could be more broadly applied - for instance to
   other encrypted transport protocols - but the scale of adoption,
   invention, and discussion of messenger software demands a focused
   document which deals exclusively with the particular use-case, common
   features and foibles of end-to-end secure, encrypted messenger
   software.

   Future documents may explore the aspects of this duck test which are
   well-suited for other purposes.
