     All participants MUST be peers who MUST have equal access to any
     given message's PCASM.

  3.2.  Transparency of Participation
  
     The existence of all current conversation participants MUST be
     visible at the current time to all current conversation participants.
  
  3.3.  Integrity of Participation
  
     Excusing the "retransmission exception", PCASM of any given message
     MUST only be available to the fixed set of conversation participants
     from whom, to whom, and at the time when it was sent.
  
  3.3.1.  Retransmission Exception
  
     If a participant that can access an "original" message intentionally
--- 182,231 ----
     All participants MUST be peers who MUST have equal access to any
     given message's PCASM.
  
+ 3.1.1.  Why do we need this?
  
!    Without equality of participation it would be allowed for a person to
!    deploy a standalone cleartext chat server, available solely over TLS-
!    encrypted links, declare themselves to be "participants" in every
!    conversation from its outset, access all message PCASM on that basis,
!    and yet call themselves an E2ESM.
! 
!    So this is an "anti-cheating" clause: all participant access to PCASM
!    MUST be via the same mechanisms for all participants without favour
!    or privilege, and in particular PCASM MUST NOT be available via other
!    means, e.g. raw filestore, database access or network sniffing.
  
  3.2.  Transparency of Participation
  
     The existence of all current conversation participants MUST be
     visible at the current time to all current conversation participants.
  
+ 3.2.1.  Why do we need this?
+ 
+    The "ends" of "end to end" are the participants; for a message to be
+    composed to be exclusively accessible to that set of participants,
+    all participants must be visible.
+ 
  3.3.  Integrity of Participation
  
     Excusing the "retransmission exception", PCASM of any given message
     MUST only be available to the fixed set of conversation participants
     from whom, to whom, and at the time when it was sent.

     outside of the above-defined sets of participants will be "non-
     participants" in respect of that message.
  
+ 3.3.3.  Why do we need this?
+ 
+    Inherent in the term "end to end secure messenger" is the intention
+    that PCASM will only be available to the participants ("ends") at the
+    time the message was composed.
+ 
+    If this was not the intention we would deduce that an E2ESM would
+    automatically make past content available to newly-added conversation
+    participants, thereby breaking forward secrecy.  This is not a
+    characteristic of any E2ESM, but it is characteristic of several non-
+    E2ESM.  Therefore the converse is true.

--- 304,323 ----
  
     A participant is any entity - human, machine, software bot,
     conversation archiver, or other, that is bounded by the extent of
!    that entity's Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
! 
!    It is important to note that the concept of "participant", defined by
!    their TCB, is a foundation for all other trust.  Developing from the
!    basic definitions of a [TrustedComputingBase] and from the concept of
!    "trust-to-trust" discussed in [RoleOfTrust], a failure of a
!    participant to maintain integrity over their own (trusted)
!    environment should not be considered a failure of an E2ESM that
!    connects it to other participants.
! 
!    Further: it is obviously possible to burden the E2ESM with surfacing
!    potential integrity issues of any given participant; but to require
!    such in this standard would risk harming the privacy of the
!    participant entity.
