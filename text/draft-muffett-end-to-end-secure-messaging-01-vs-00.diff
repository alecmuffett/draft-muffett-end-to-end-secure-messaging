     A participant is any entity - human, machine, software bot,
     conversation archiver, or other, that is bounded by the extent of
!    that entity's Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
! 
!    It is important to note that the concept of "participant", defined by
!    their TCB, is a foundation for all other trust.  Developing from the
!    basic definitions of a [TrustedComputingBase] and from the concept of
!    "trust-to-trust" discussed in [RoleOfTrust], a failure of a
!    participant to maintain integrity over their own (trusted)
!    environment should not be considered a failure of an E2ESM that
!    connects it to other participants.
! 
!    Further: it is obviously possible to burden the E2ESM with surfacing
!    potential integrity issues of any given participant; but to require
!    such in this standard would risk harming the privacy of the
!    participant entity.

! 4.1.1.  Scope of a Participant in E2ESM
! 
!    The term "participant" in this document exists to supersede the more
!    vague notion of "end" in the phrase "end-to-end".
! 
!    Participants are defined in terms of an entity's
!    [TrustedComputingBase] to acknowledge that an entity MAY legitimately
!    store, forward, or access messages by means that are outside of the
!    E2ESM software.
! 
!    For example: if a participant accesses their E2ESM software via
!    remote desktop software, and their RDP session is hijacked by a third
!    party; of if they back-up their messages in cleartext to cloud
!    storage leading somehow to data exfiltration, neither of these would
!    be a failure of E2ESM.  This would instead be a failure of the
!    participant's [TrustedComputingBase].

  4.3.4.  Conversation Metadata (OPTIONAL)
  
     Whether per-conversation "group" metadata, such as "group titles",
     "group topics", "group icons", or "group participant lists"
!    constitute PCASM, is an OPTIONAL choice for E2ESM software, but that
!    choice MUST be made apparent to participants.
  
  4.4.  Backdoor
  
***************
*** 379,421 ****
     MUST combine both notions of an access mechanism (e.g. "door") and a
     definite or suspected intention (e.g. "legal obligation").
  
     So the phrase "back door" is brief, clear, and widely understood to
     mean "a secondary means of access".  In the above definition we
     already allow for the term to be prefixed with "intentional" or
     "unintentional".

!    Thus it seems appropriate to use this term in this context, not least
!    because it is also not far removed from the similar and established
!    term "side channel".
  
! 5.  Scope of a Participant in E2ESM
  
!    The term "participant" in this document exists to supercede the more
!    vague notion of "end" in the phrase "end-to-end".
  
!    Participants are defined in terms of an entity's
!    [TrustedComputingBase] to acknowledge that an entity MAY legitimately
!    store, forward, or access messages by means that are outside of the
!    E2ESM software.
  
!    For example: if a participant accesses their E2ESM software via
!    remote desktop software, and their RDP session is hijacked by a third
!    party; of if they back-up their messages in cleartext to cloud
!    storage leading somehow to data exfiltration, neither of these would
!    be a failure of E2ESM.  This would instead be a failure of the
!    participant's [TrustedComputingBase].
  
! 6.  Rationale
  
     Consider FooBook, a hypothetical example company which provides
     messaging services for conversations between entities who use it.

     mean "a secondary means of access".  In the above definition we

+    because it is also not far removed from the similar and established
+    term "side channel".
+ 
+ 5.  Rationale
+ 
+    This explanatory section regarding the principles has been broken out
+    for clarity and argumentation purposes.
+ 
+ 5.1.  Why: Equality of Participation
+ 
+    Without equality of participation it would be allowed for a person to
+    deploy a standalone cleartext chat server, available solely over TLS-
+    encrypted links, declare themselves to be "participants" in every
+    conversation from its outset, access all message PCASM on that basis,
+    and yet call themselves an E2ESM.
+ 
+    So this is an "anti-cheating" clause: all participant access to PCASM
+    MUST be via the same mechanisms for all participants without favour
+    or privilege, and in particular PCASM MUST NOT be available via other
+    means, e.g. raw filestore, database access or network sniffing.
+ 
+ 5.2.  Why: Transparency of Participation
+ 
+    The "ends" of "end to end" are the participants; for a message to be
+    composed to be exclusively accessible to that set of participants,
+    all participants must be visible.
  
+ 5.3.  Why: Integrity of Participation
  
+    Inherent in the term "end to end secure messenger" is the intention
+    that PCASM will only be available to the participants ("ends") at the
+    time the message was composed.
  
+    If this was not the intention we would deduce that an E2ESM would
+    automatically make past content available to newly-added conversation
+    participants, thereby breaking forward secrecy.  This is not a
+    characteristic of any E2ESM, but it is characteristic of several non-
+    E2ESM.  Therefore the converse is true.

! 5.4.  Why: Closure of Conversation
  
!    If a conversation is not "only extensible from within" then it would
!    be possible for participants to be injected into the conversation
!    thereby defeating the closure of message distribution.
  
! 5.5.  Why: Management and Visibility of Participant Clients and Devices
  
!    *TODO*: touch also upon mutual assurance & authentication.
  
! 6.  Examples of PCASM
! 
!    For an example message with a plaintext content ("content") of
!    "Hello, world.", for the purposes of this example encoded as an ASCII
!    string of length 13 bytes without terminator character.
! 
! 6.1.  Content PCASM
! 
!    Examples of Content PCASM would include, non-exclusively:

!    1.  The content is "Hello, world."
! 
!    2.  The content starts with the word "Hello"
! 
!    3.  The top bit of the first byte of the content, is zero
! 
!    4.  The MD5 hash of the content is 080aef839b95facf73ec599375e92d47
! 
!    5.  The Salted-MD5 Hash of the content is : ...
! 
! 6.2.  Size PCASM
! 
!    Size PCASM is defined in the main text, as it relates to the
!    transport and/or content encryption mechanisms.
! 
! 6.3.  Analytic PCASM
! 
!    Examples of Analytic PCASM would include, non-exclusively:
! 
!    1.  The content contains the substring "ello"
! 
!    2.  The content does not contain the word "Goodbye"
! 
!    3.  The content contains a substring from amongst the following set:
!        ...
! 
!    4.  The content does not contain a substring from amongst the
!        following set: ...

!    Examples of Conversation Metadata are given in the main text.
! 
! 6.5.  Non-PCASM
! 
!    Information which would not be PCASM would include, non-exclusively:

! 
!    2.  The content is sent to Bob
