<h1 class="special" id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>This draft
describes a test
which <strong>MAY</strong> be used
to falsify claims that
a messaging
or messenger application,
platform,
solution,
or service (&ldquo;messaging solution&rdquo;)
provides
either or both of
&ldquo;end-to-end security&rdquo;
or
&ldquo;end-to-end encryption&rdquo;.
(either/both: &ldquo;E2E&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Any
messaging solution,
or clearly defined
subset thereof,
which claims to
provide E2E,
<strong>MUST</strong>
satisfy
this test;
however
satisfaction of
this test
is not
wholly sufficient
to determine that
the messaging solution
actually provides E2E.</p>
<section data-matter="main">
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>&ldquo;End-to-end security&rdquo; and
&ldquo;end-to-end encryption&rdquo;
offer digital analogues
of &ldquo;closed distribution lists&rdquo;
for sharing content
amongst a set of intended recipients,
where all others
are fully excluded
from access to content.</p>

<p>This draft
assumes
a specific
application of
&ldquo;end-to-end security&rdquo;
or
&ldquo;end-to-end encryption&rdquo;
towards the
specific use case
of individual and group
messaging solutions
where entities
who are later added
to a messaging group
<strong>MUST NOT</strong>
be able
to access
previously-sent content.</p>

<p>In turn,
use cases
for such
messaging solutions
include
the sending
and receiving
of any
or all of:</p>

<ol>
<li>UNICODE or ASCII messages</li>
<li>images, video files or audio files</li>
<li>one-way streaming video or audio</li>
<li>two-way streaming video or audio, as in live calls</li>
</ol>

<p>The application
of this test
does not
depend upon
whether the
messaging solution
is built upon a
centralized,
distributed,
hybrid,
or any other
network model.</p>

<p>Use cases of
an entity
<strong>MAY</strong> include being

or something other
which sends
and/or receives
messages.</p>

<h2 id="content">Content</h2>

<p>Plaintext content (&ldquo;content&rdquo;)
is information
of 0 or more bits,
to be communicated.</p>

<h2 id="metadata-and-pcasm">Metadata and PCASM</h2>

<p>Plaintext content
and
sensitive metadata (&ldquo;PCASM&rdquo;)
is the
union set of
content
and
associated
&ldquo;metadata&rdquo;
that describes
the content,
comprising
any or all of:</p>

<h3 id="content-metadata">Content Metadata</h3>

<p>Content Metadata
is any data
that can offer
better than 50% certainty
regarding the value of
any bit
of the content.
Self-evidently,
this also includes
the value of
the content
itself.</p>

<h3 id="size-metadata">Size Metadata</h3>

<ol>
<li>For block encryption
of content,
&ldquo;size metadata&rdquo;
is the
unpadded size
of the content.</li>
<li>For stream encryption
of content,
&ldquo;size metadata&rdquo;
is currently undefined. (TODO)</li>
<li>For transport encryption
of content,
accurate &ldquo;size metadata&rdquo;
<strong>SHOULD NOT</strong>
be observable
or inferable.</li>

<h3 id="analytic-metadata">Analytic Metadata</h3>

<p>Analytic Metadata
is data
that analyses,
describes,
reduces,
or summarises
the content.</p>

<h2 id="message-and-intended-recipients">Message and Intended Recipients</h2>

<p>A &ldquo;message&rdquo;
is zero-or-more
bits of
content
which has been
composed by
a sender
and which
is bound
to a fixed
and immutable
set of
zero or more
recipients
(&ldquo;intended recipients&rdquo;)
for that message.</p>

<h2 id="recipient">Recipient</h2>

<p>A &ldquo;recipient&rdquo;
of a message
is an entity
which <strong>MAY</strong>
derive
any PCASM
for that message.
Recipients
of a message
<strong>MAY</strong>
exist outside
of the set
of intended recipients
for that message.
Means of derivation
<strong>MAY</strong>
include
analysis of
a larger corpus
of messages.</p>

<h2 id="sender">Sender</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;sender&rdquo;
of a message
is an entity
which composes
that message
to a set
of intended recipients
and sends
that message
into the
messaging solution.</p>

<h2 id="platform">Platform</h2>

<p>A &ldquo;platform&rdquo;
is an entity
which provides
a messaging solution.</p>

<h2 id="conversation-and-group-conversation">Conversation and Group Conversation</h2>

<p>TODO</p>

<h2 id="backdoor">Backdoor</h2>

<p>A &ldquo;backdoor&rdquo;
is
any intentional
or unintentional
feature
of a messaging solution
whereby,
in respect of
a given message
some PCASM
of that message
<strong>MAY</strong> become available
to an entity
that is not
an intended recipient
of that message,</p>

<p>other than by
the intentional action
of an intended recipient.</p>

<h1 id="test-preconditions">Test Preconditions</h1>

<p>The following
preconditions
<strong>MUST</strong> be met for
the test

Failure to
satisfy these
preconditions
is a failure
of the test.</p>

<h2 id="recipients-are-peers">Recipients are Peers</h2>

<p>For any message,
there exists no method
to access its PCASM
where that method
is not equally available
to all recipients.</p>

<h2 id="conversation-group-centralised-decentralised">Conversation, Group, Centralised &amp; Decentralised</h2>

<p>A &ldquo;conversation&rdquo;
is a sequence
of one or more messages,
and the responses
or replies
to them,
over a period of time,
amongst a constant
or evolving
set of participants.</p>

<p>A given platform <strong>MAY</strong>
distinguish between
and support
more than one conversation
at any given time.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;centralised&rdquo; E2ESM
such as WhatsApp or Signal,
the software <strong>MAY</strong>
offer collective
&ldquo;group&rdquo; conversation contexts
that provide
prefabricated sets
of recipients
for the client
to utilise
when a message
is composed or sent.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;decentralised&rdquo; E2ESM
such as PGP-Encrypted Email
or Ricochet
the recipients of each message
are individually determined
by each sender
at the point of composition;
however &ldquo;group&rdquo; metadata
may also exist,
in terms of
(e.g.) email addressees
or subject lines.</p>

<h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>

<p>For a series of
one or more &ldquo;messages&rdquo;
each which are composed
of &ldquo;plaintext content and sensitive metadata&rdquo; (PCASM)
and which constitute
a &ldquo;conversation&rdquo;
amongst a set of &ldquo;participants&rdquo;,
to provide E2ESM
will require:</p>

<h2 id="transparency-of-participation">Transparency of Participation</h2>

<p>In the nature
of &ldquo;closed distribution lists&rdquo;,
the participants
in a message
<strong>MUST</strong> be
frozen into
an immutable set
at the moment
when the message
is composed or sent.</p>

<p>The complete set
of all recipients
<strong>MUST</strong> be visible
to the sender
at the moment
of message composition or sending.</p>

<p>The complete set
of participants
in a message
<strong>MUST</strong> be visible
to all other participants.</p>

<h2 id="integrity-of-participation">Integrity of Participation</h2>

<p>Excusing the
&ldquo;retransmission exception&rdquo;,
PCASM
of any given message
<strong>MUST</strong> only be available
to the fixed set
of conversation participants
from whom,
to whom,
and at the time when
it was sent.</p>

<h3 id="retransmission-exception">Retransmission Exception</h3>

<p>If a participant
that can access
an &ldquo;original&rdquo; message
intentionally &ldquo;retransmits&rdquo;
(e.g. quotes, forwards)
that message
to create
a new message
within the E2ESM software,
then
the original message&rsquo;s PCASM
<strong>MAY</strong>
become available
to a new,
additional,
and
possibly different
set of
conversation participants,
via that new message.</p>

<h2 id="equality-of-participation">Equality of Participation</h2>

<p>All participants
<strong>MUST</strong> be peers,
i.e. they
<strong>MUST</strong> have equal access
to the PCASM
of any message;
see also
&ldquo;Integrity of Participation&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="closure-of-conversation">Closure of Conversation</h2>

<p>The set of participants
in a conversation
<strong>SHALL NOT</strong> be increased
except by the intentional action
of one or more
existing participants.</p>

<p>Per &ldquo;Transparency of Participation&rdquo;
that action
(introducing a new participant)
<strong>MUST</strong>
be visible to
all other participants</p>

<h3 id="public-conversations-and-self-subscription">Public Conversations and Self-Subscription</h3>

<p>Existing participants <strong>MAY</strong>
publicly share
links to the conversation,
identifying data
to assist discovery of the conversation,
or other mechanisms
to enable
non-participant entities
to subscribe themselves
as conversation participants.
This <strong>MAY</strong> be
considered
legitimate
&ldquo;intentional action&rdquo;
to increase the set of participants
in the group.</p>

<h2 id="management-of-participant-clients-and-devices">Management of Participant Clients and Devices</h2>

<p>Where there
exists
centralised
E2ESM software
that hosts
participants:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The E2ESM software
<strong>MUST</strong> provide
each participant entity
with means
to review or revoke access for
that participant&rsquo;s
clients or devices
that can access
future PCASM.</p></li>

<li><p>The E2ESM software
<strong>MUST</strong> provide
each participant entity
with notifications
and/or complete logs
of changes
to the set of
clients or devices
that can or could access
message PCASM.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="rationales">Rationales</h1>

<p>This explanatory section
regarding the principles
has been broken out
for clarity and argumentation purposes.</p>

<h2 id="why-content-pcasm">Why: Content PCASM</h2>

<p>Content PCASM
<strong>MUST</strong> be protected
as it comprises
that which is
&ldquo;closed&rdquo; from general distribution.</p>

<p>The test
for measuring this
is (intended to be) modeled upon
ciphertext indistinguishability <cite class="informative"><a href="#CipherInd"><sup>[CipherInd]</sup></a></cite></p>

<h2 id="why-size-pcasm">Why: Size PCASM</h2>

<p>Exact size PCASM
<strong>MUST</strong> be protected
as it <strong>MAY</strong>
offer insight into
Content PCASM.</p>

<p>The test
for measuring this
is (intended) to address
risk of content
becoming evident
via plaintext length.</p>

<h2 id="why-analytic-pcasm">Why: Analytic PCASM</h2>

<p>Analytic PCASM
<strong>MUST</strong> be protected
as it <strong>MAY</strong>
offer insight into
Content PCASM,
for instance
that the content
shares features
with other,
specimen,
or known plaintext content.</p>

<h2 id="why-conversation-metadata-as-optional-pcasm">Why: Conversation Metadata as <strong>OPTIONAL</strong> PCASM</h2>

<p>Conversational Metadata <strong>MAY</strong>
offer insight into
Content PCASM,
however the abstractions
of transport mechanism,
group management,
or platform choice,
<strong>MAY</strong> render this moot.</p>

<p>For example
an PGP-Encrypted email distribution list
named &ldquo;blockchain-fans@example.com&rdquo;
would leak
its implicit topic
and participant identities
to capable observers.</p>

<h2 id="why-entity-and-participant">Why: Entity and Participant</h2>

<p>The term &ldquo;participant&rdquo;
in this document
exists to supersede
the more vague notion of &ldquo;end&rdquo;
in the phrase &ldquo;end-to-end&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Entities,
and thus participants,
are defined
in terms of their <cite class="informative"><a href="#TrustedComputingBase"><sup>[TrustedComputingBase]</sup></a></cite>
to acknowledge
that an entity
<strong>MAY</strong> legitimately
store, forward, or access messages
by means
that are outside of
the E2ESM software.</p>

<p>It is important to note
that the concept of &ldquo;entity&rdquo;
as defined by their TCB,
is the foundation
for all other trust in E2ESM.
This develops from
the basic definitions of
a <cite class="informative"><a href="#TrustedComputingBase"><sup>[TrustedComputingBase]</sup></a></cite>
and from the concepts of
&ldquo;trust-to-trust&rdquo; discussed in <cite class="informative"><a href="#RoleOfTrust"><sup>[RoleOfTrust]</sup></a></cite>.
Failure of a participant
to maintain integrity or control
over their TCB
should not be considered
a failure of an E2ESM
that connects it to other participants.</p>

<p>For example:
if a participant
accesses their E2ESM software
via remote desktop software,
and their RDP session is hijacked by a third party;
of if they back-up their messages
in cleartext
to cloud storage
leading somehow to data exfiltration,
neither of these
would be a failure of E2ESM.
This would instead
be a failure
of the participant&rsquo;s
<cite class="informative"><a href="#TrustedComputingBase"><sup>[TrustedComputingBase]</sup></a></cite>.</p>

<p>Further:
it would be
obviously possible
to burden
an E2ESM
with surfacing
potential integrity issues
of any given participant
to other participants,
e.g. &ldquo;patch compliance&rdquo;.
But to require such
in this standard
would risk harming
the privacy
of the participant entity.
See also: &ldquo;Mutual Identity Verification&rdquo;
in &ldquo;<strong>OPTIONAL</strong> Features of E2ESM&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="why-transparency-of-participation">Why: Transparency of Participation</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;ends&rdquo;
of &ldquo;end to end&rdquo;
are the participants;
for a message to be composed
to be exclusively accessible
to that set of participants,
all participants must be visible.</p>

<p>For
decentralised
&ldquo;virtual point-to-point&rdquo;
E2ESM solutions
such as PGP-Encrypted Email
or Ricochet,
the set of participants
is fixed
by the author
at the time
of individual message composition,
and <strong>MUST</strong>
be visible
to all participants.</p>

<p>For &ldquo;centralised&rdquo;
E2ESM solutions
such as Signal
or WhatsApp,
the set of participants
is a &ldquo;group context&rdquo;
shared amongst all participants
and at the time
of individual message composition
it <strong>MUST</strong>
be inherited
into a set of
&ldquo;fixed&rdquo; per-participant
access capabilities
by the author.</p>

<h2 id="why-integrity-of-participation">Why: Integrity of Participation</h2>

<p>Inherent in the term
&ldquo;end to end secure messenger&rdquo;
is the intention
that PCASM
will only be available
to the participants (&ldquo;ends&rdquo;)
at the time the message was composed.</p>

<p>If this was not the intention
we would deduce
that an E2ESM
would automatically make
past content
available to
newly-added conversation participants,
thereby breaking
forward secrecy.
This is not
a characteristic
of any E2ESM,
but it is
characteristic of
several non-E2ESM.
Therefore
the converse
is true.</p>

<p>As a concrete example
this means
that participants
who are
newly added
to a &ldquo;group&rdquo;
<strong>MUST NOT</strong>
be able
to read messages
that were
sent before
they joined
that group -
unless
(for instance)
one pre-existing participant
is explicitly intended
to provide
a &ldquo;searchable archive&rdquo;
or similar function.
The function
of such a participant
is considered to be
out of scope
for the messenger.</p>

<h2 id="why-equality-of-participation">Why: Equality of Participation</h2>

<p>Without equality of participation
it would be allowed
for a person to deploy
a standalone cleartext chat server,
available solely over TLS-encrypted links,
declare themselves to be &ldquo;participants&rdquo;
in every conversation from its outset,
access all message PCASM on that basis,
and yet call themselves an E2ESM.</p>

<p>So this is an &ldquo;anti-cheating&rdquo; clause:
all participant access to PCASM
<strong>MUST</strong> be via
the same mechanisms
for all participants
without favour or privilege,
and in particular
PCASM <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
be available via other means,
e.g.
raw block-device access,
raw filestore,
raw database access,
or network sniffing.</p>

<h2 id="why-closure-of-conversation">Why: Closure of Conversation</h2>

<p>If a conversation
is not
&ldquo;only extensible from within&rdquo;
then it would be possible
for participants
to be injected
into the conversation
thereby defeating
the closure of message distribution.</p>

<p>A subtle
centralised vs: decentralised
edge-case is as follows:
consider a
PGP-encrypted email distribution list.
Would it break &ldquo;closure of conversation&rdquo;
for a non-participant
email administrator
to simply add new users
to the maillist?</p>

<p>Answer: no, because
in this case
the maillist
is functioning
as a &ldquo;platform&rdquo;
for multiple &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; threads,
and mere addition of
of a new
&ldquo;transport-level&rdquo;
maillist member
would not include them
as a participant
in ongoing E2ESM conversations;
such inclusion
would be a future burden
upon existing participants.</p>

<p>However:
similar external injection
of a new entity
into a centralised
WhatsApp or Signal &ldquo;group&rdquo;
would be clearly a breach
of &ldquo;closure of conversation&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="why-management-of-participant-clients-and-devices">Why: Management of Participant Clients and Devices</h2>

<p>There is little benefit
in requiring
conversations
to be closed
against &ldquo;participant injection&rdquo;
if a non-participant
may obtain
PCASM access
by forcing a platform
to silently add
extra means of PCASM access
to an existing participant
on behalf of that non-participant.</p>

<p>Therefore
to be an E2ESM
the platform
<strong>MUST</strong> provide
the described
management of participant clients and devices.</p>

<h1 id="optional-features-of-e2esm"><strong>OPTIONAL</strong> Features of E2ESM</h1>

<h2 id="disappearing-messages">Disappearing Messages</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Disappearing&rdquo;,
&ldquo;expiring&rdquo;,
&ldquo;exploding&rdquo;,
&ldquo;ephemeral&rdquo;
or other forms of
time-limited access to PCASM
are strongly <strong>RECOMMENDED</strong>
but not obligatory
mechanisms
for E2ESM,
not least
because they
are impossible to implement
in a way that cannot be circumvented
by e.g. screenshots.</p>

<h2 id="mutual-identity-verification">Mutual Identity Verification</h2>

<p>Some manner of
&ldquo;shared key&rdquo;
which mutually assures
participant identity
and communications integrity
are strongly <strong>RECOMMENDED</strong>
but not obligatory
mechanisms
for E2ESM.</p>

<p>The benefits
of such mechanisms
are limited to certain perspectives
of certain platforms.</p>

<p>For instance:
in Ricochet
the identity key
of a user
is the absolute source of truth
for their identity,
and excusing detection of typographic errors
there is nothing which can be added to that
in order to further assure their &ldquo;identity&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Similarly WhatsApp
provides each participant
with a &ldquo;verifiable security QR code&rdquo;
and &ldquo;security code change notifications&rdquo;,
but these codes
do not &ldquo;leak&rdquo; the number
of &ldquo;WhatsApp For Web&rdquo; connections,
desktop WhatsApp applications,
or other clients
which are bound to
the E2ESM software
which executes on that phone.</p>

<p>Participant-client information
of this kind
<strong>MAY</strong> be
a highly private aspect
of that participant&rsquo;s TCB,
and <strong>SHOULD</strong> be treated
sensitively by platforms.</p>

<h1 id="examples-of-pcasm">Examples of PCASM</h1>
