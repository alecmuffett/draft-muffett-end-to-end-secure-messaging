<p>This document
defines End-to-End Secure Messaging
in terms of the behaviours
that <strong>MUST</strong> be exhibited
by software
that claims to implement it,
or which claims to implement
that subset which is known as
End-to-End Encrypted Messaging.</p>
<section data-matter="main">
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>End-to-End Secure Messaging (E2ESM)
is a mechanism
which offers a digital analogue
of &ldquo;closed distribution lists&rdquo;
for sharing message content
amongst a set of participants,
where all participants
are visible to each other
and where non-participants
are excluded
from access to message content.</p>

<p>In client-server network models
it is common to implement E2ESM
by means of encryption,
in order to obscure
content at rest
upon a central server.
So therefore E2ESM
is often
narrowly regarded
in terms of &ldquo;end-to-end encryption&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Other architectural approaches exist -
for instance <cite class="informative"><a href="#RicochetRefresh"><sup>[RicochetRefresh]</sup></a></cite>
which implements
closed distribution
by using
secure point-to-point <cite class="informative"><a href="#RFC7686"><sup>[RFC7686]</sup></a></cite> networking
to literally restrict
the distribution
of plaintext content
to relevant participants.</p>

<p>Therefore we describe E2ESM
in terms of
functional behaviours
of the software
rather than
in terms
of implementation
goals and technologies.</p>

<h2 id="notational-conventions">Notational Conventions</h2>

<p>The key words &ldquo;MUST&rdquo;, &ldquo;MUST NOT&rdquo;, &ldquo;REQUIRED&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHALL&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHALL NOT&rdquo;,
&ldquo;SHOULD&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHOULD NOT&rdquo;, &ldquo;RECOMMENDED&rdquo;, &ldquo;NOT RECOMMENDED&rdquo;, &ldquo;MAY&rdquo;, and

capitals, as shown here.</p>

<h1 id="requirements-for-an-end-to-end-secure-messenger">Requirements for an End-to-End Secure Messenger</h1>

<p>Software which functions
as an
End-to-End Secure Messenger
<strong>MUST</strong> satisfy the following principles, and
<strong>MUST</strong> satisfy these principles in respect of the provided definitions
for all forms of communication
and data-sharing
that the software offers.
The software
<strong>MAY</strong> comprise
either a complete application,
or a clearly defined subset
of functionality
within a
larger application.</p>

<p>Any software
that does not
satisfy these requirements
is not an
End-to-End Secure Messenger,
and it does not implement
End-to-End Secure Messaging,
nor does it implement
End-to-End Encrypted Messaging.</p>

<h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>

<p>For a series of
one or more &ldquo;messages&rdquo;
each which are composed
of &ldquo;plaintext content and sensitive metadata&rdquo; (PCASM)
and which constitute
a &ldquo;conversation&rdquo;
amongst a set of &ldquo;participants&rdquo;,
to provide E2ESM
will require:</p>

<h2 id="equality-of-participation">Equality of Participation</h2>

<p>All participants
<strong>MUST</strong> be peers who
<strong>MUST</strong> have equal access
to any given message&rsquo;s PCASM.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-need-this">Why do we need this?</h3>

<p>Without equality of participation
it would be allowed
for a person to deploy
a standalone cleartext chat server,
available solely over TLS-encrypted links,
declare themselves to be &ldquo;participants&rdquo;
in every conversation from its outset,
access all message PCASM on that basis,
and yet call themselves an E2ESM.</p>

<p>So this is an &ldquo;anti-cheating&rdquo; clause:
all participant access to PCASM
<strong>MUST</strong> be via
the same mechanisms
for all participants
without favour or privilege,
and in particular
PCASM <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
be available via other means,
e.g.
raw filestore,
database access
or network sniffing.</p>

<h2 id="transparency-of-participation">Transparency of Participation</h2>

<p>The existence
of all current
conversation participants
<strong>MUST</strong> be visible
at the current
time
to all current
conversation participants.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-need-this-1">Why do we need this?</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;ends&rdquo; of &ldquo;end to end&rdquo; are the participants;
for a message to be composed
to be exclusively accessible
to that set of participants,
all participants must be visible.</p>

<h2 id="integrity-of-participation">Integrity of Participation</h2>

<p>Excusing the
&ldquo;retransmission exception&rdquo;,
PCASM
of any given message
<strong>MUST</strong> only be available
to the fixed set
of conversation participants
from whom,
to whom,
and at the time when
it was sent.</p>

<h3 id="retransmission-exception">Retransmission Exception</h3>

<p>If a participant
that can access
an &ldquo;original&rdquo; message
intentionally &ldquo;retransmits&rdquo;
(e.g. quotes, forwards)
that message
to create
a new message
within the E2ESM software,
then
the original message&rsquo;s PCASM
<strong>MAY</strong>
become available
to a new,
additional,
and
possibly different
set of
conversation participants,
via that new message.</p>

<h3 id="non-participation">Non-Participation</h3>

<p>It follows that
for any given message,
all entities
that exist
outside of
the above-defined sets of participants
will be &ldquo;non-participants&rdquo;
in respect of that message.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-need-this-2">Why do we need this?</h3>

<p>Inherent in the term
&ldquo;end to end secure messenger&rdquo;
is the intention
that PCASM
will only be available
to the participants (&ldquo;ends&rdquo;)
at the time the message was composed.</p>

<p>If this was not the intention
we would deduce
that an E2ESM
would automatically make
past content
available to
newly-added conversation participants,
thereby breaking
forward secrecy.
This is not
a characteristic
of any E2ESM,
but it is
characteristic of
several non-E2ESM.
Therefore
the converse
is true.</p>

<h2 id="closure-of-conversation">Closure of Conversation</h2>

<p>The set of participants
in a conversation
<strong>SHALL NOT</strong> be increased
except by the intentional action
of one or more
existing participants.</p>

<h3 id="public-conversations-and-self-subscription">Public Conversations and Self-Subscription</h3>

<p>Existing participants <strong>MAY</strong>
publicly share
links,
data,
or other mechanisms
to enable
non-participant entities
to subscribe themselves
as conversation participants.
This <strong>MAY</strong> be
considered
legitimate
&ldquo;intentional action&rdquo;
to increase the set of participants
in the group.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-need-this-3">Why do we need this?</h3>

<p>If a conversation
is not &ldquo;only extensible from within&rdquo;
then it would be possible
for participants
to be injected
into the conversation
thereby defeating
the closure of message distribution.</p>

<h2 id="management-and-visibility-of-participant-clients-and-devices">Management and Visibility of Participant Clients and Devices</h2>

<p>Where there
exists
centralised
E2ESM software
that hosts
participants:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The E2ESM software
<strong>MUST</strong> provide
each participant entity
with means
to review or revoke access for
clients or devices
that can access
future PCASM.</p></li>

<li><p>The E2ESM software
<strong>MUST</strong> provide
each participant entity
with notifications
and/or complete logs
of changes
to the set of
clients or devices
that can or could access
message PCASM.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="definitions">Definitions</h1>

<p>These principles
<strong>MUST</strong> be measured
with respect to
the following definitions:</p>

<h2 id="participant">Participant</h2>

<p>A participant
is any entity -
human,
machine,
software bot,
conversation archiver,
or other,
that is bounded
by the extent
of that entity&rsquo;s
Trusted Computing Base (TCB).</p>

<p>It is important to note
that the concept of &ldquo;participant&rdquo;,
defined by their TCB,
is a foundation for all other trust.
Developing from
the basic definitions of
a  <cite class="informative"><a href="#TrustedComputingBase"><sup>[TrustedComputingBase]</sup></a></cite>
and from the concept of
&ldquo;trust-to-trust&rdquo; discussed in <cite class="informative"><a href="#RoleOfTrust"><sup>[RoleOfTrust]</sup></a></cite>,
a failure of a participant
to maintain integrity
over their own (trusted) environment
should not be considered
a failure of an E2ESM
that connects it to other participants.</p>

<p>Further: it is
obviously possible
to burden
the E2ESM
with surfacing
potential integrity issues
of any given participant;
but to require such
in this standard
would risk harming
the privacy
of the participant entity.</p>

<h2 id="conversation">Conversation</h2>

<p>A conversation
is a sequence
of one or more messages
over a period of time
amongst a constant or evolving
set of participants.</p>

<h2 id="plaintext-content-and-sensitive-metadata-pcasm">Plaintext Content and Sensitive Metadata (PCASM)</h2>

<p>The PCASM
of a message
is defined as
any of:</p>

<h3 id="content-pcasm">Content PCASM</h3>

<p>Content PCASM
is any data
that can offer
better than 50-50 certainty
regarding the value of
any given bit
of the plaintext message content. (&ldquo;content&rdquo;)</p>

<h3 id="size-pcasm">Size PCASM</h3>

<p>For block encryption of content,
Size PCASM is the unpadded size of the content.</p>

<p>For stream encryption of content,
Size PCASM is currently undefined.</p>

<p>For transport encryption of content,
precise Size PCASM <strong>SHOULD NOT</strong> be observable.</p>

<h3 id="analytic-pcasm">Analytic PCASM</h3>

<p>Analytic PCASM
is data
that describes
the &ldquo;content&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="conversation-metadata-optional">Conversation Metadata (<strong>OPTIONAL</strong>)</h3>

<p>Whether
per-conversation
&ldquo;group&rdquo; metadata,
such as
&ldquo;group titles&rdquo;,
&ldquo;group topics&rdquo;,
&ldquo;group icons&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;group participant lists&rdquo;
constitute PCASM,
is an
<strong>OPTIONAL</strong>
choice
for E2ESM software,
but that choice
<strong>MUST</strong>
be made apparent
to participants.</p>

<h2 id="backdoor">Backdoor</h2>

<p>A &ldquo;backdoor&rdquo;
is any
intentional or unintentional mechanism,
in respect of a given message
and that message&rsquo;s set of participants,
where some PCASM
of that message
<strong>MAY</strong> become available
to a non-participant
without the intentional action of a participant.</p>

<h3 id="why-call-this-a-backdoor">Why call this a &ldquo;backdoor&rdquo;?</h3>

<p>In software engineering
there is a perpetual tension
between the concepts of
&ldquo;feature&rdquo; versus &ldquo;bug&rdquo; -
and occasionally
&ldquo;misfeature&rdquo; versus &ldquo;misbug&rdquo;.
These tensions
arise from
the problem of <cite class="informative"><a href="#DualUse"><sup>[DualUse]</sup></a></cite> -
that it is
not feasible
to firmly
and completely
ascribe &ldquo;intention&rdquo;
to any hardware or software mechanism.</p>

<p>The information security community
have experienced
a historical spectrum
of mechanisms
which have assisted
non-participant access to PCASM.
These have
variously been named as
&ldquo;export-grade key restrictions&rdquo; (TLS, then Logjam),
&ldquo;side channel attacks&rdquo; (Spectre and Meltdown),
&ldquo;law enforcement access fields&rdquo; (Clipper), and
&ldquo;key escrow&rdquo; (Crypto Wars).</p>

<p>All of
these terms
combine
an &ldquo;access facilitation mechanism&rdquo;
with an &ldquo;intention or opportunity&rdquo; -
and for all of them
an access facilitation mechanism
is first <strong>REQUIRED</strong>.</p>

<p>An access facilitation mechanism
is a &ldquo;door&rdquo;,
and is inherently <cite class="informative"><a href="#DualUse"><sup>[DualUse]</sup></a></cite>.
Because the goal
of E2ESM
is to limit
access to PCASM
exclusively to
a defined set of participants,
then the intended
means of access
is clearly the &ldquo;front door&rdquo;;
and any other access mechanism
is a &ldquo;back door&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If the term
&ldquo;back door&rdquo;
is considered
innately pejorative,
alternative, uncertain constructions
such as
&ldquo;illegitimate access feature&rdquo;,
&ldquo;potentially intentional data-access weakness&rdquo;,
&ldquo;legally-obligated exceptional access mechanism&rdquo;,
or any other phrase,
all <strong>MUST</strong> combine
both notions
of an access mechanism (e.g. &ldquo;door&rdquo;)
and a definite or suspected intention (e.g. &ldquo;legal obligation&rdquo;).</p>

<p>So the phrase
&ldquo;back door&rdquo;
is brief,
clear,
and widely understood
to mean &ldquo;a secondary means of access&rdquo;.
In the above definition
we already allow
for the term to be prefixed
with &ldquo;intentional&rdquo; or &ldquo;unintentional&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Thus it seems
appropriate
to use this term
in this context,
not least because
it is also not far removed
from the similar
and established term
&ldquo;side channel&rdquo;.</p>

<h1 id="scope-of-a-participant-in-e2esm">Scope of a Participant in E2ESM</h1>

<p>The term &ldquo;participant&rdquo;
in this document
exists to supersede
the more vague notion of &ldquo;end&rdquo;
in the phrase &ldquo;end-to-end&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Participants are defined
in terms of an entity&rsquo;s <cite class="informative"><a href="#TrustedComputingBase"><sup>[TrustedComputingBase]</sup></a></cite>
to acknowledge
that an entity
<strong>MAY</strong> legitimately
store, forward, or access messages
by means
that are outside of
the E2ESM software.</p>

<p>For example:
if a participant
accesses their E2ESM software
via remote desktop software,
and their RDP session is hijacked by a third party;
of if they back-up their messages
in cleartext
to cloud storage
leading somehow to data exfiltration,
neither of these
would be a failure of E2ESM.
This would instead
be a failure
of the participant&rsquo;s
<cite class="informative"><a href="#TrustedComputingBase"><sup>[TrustedComputingBase]</sup></a></cite>.</p>

<h1 id="examples-of-pcasm">Examples of PCASM</h1>

<p>For an example message with a plaintext content (&ldquo;content&rdquo;) of &ldquo;Hello,
world.&rdquo;, for the purposes of this example encoded as an ASCII string
of length 13 bytes without terminator character.</p>

<h2 id="content-pcasm-1">Content PCASM</h2>

<p>Examples of Content PCASM would include, non-exclusively:</p>

<ol>
<li>The content is &ldquo;Hello, world.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The content starts with the word &ldquo;Hello&rdquo;</li>
<li>The top bit of the first byte of the content, is zero</li>
<li>The MD5 hash of the content is 080aef839b95facf73ec599375e92d47</li>
<li>The Salted-MD5 Hash of the content is : &hellip;</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="size-pcasm-1">Size PCASM</h2>

<p>Size PCASM is defined in the main text, as it relates to the transport
and/or content encryption mechanisms.</p>

<h2 id="analytic-pcasm-1">Analytic PCASM</h2>

<p>Examples of Analytic PCASM would include, non-exclusively:</p>

<ol>
<li>The content contains the substring &ldquo;ello&rdquo;</li>
<li>The content does not contain the word &ldquo;Goodbye&rdquo;</li>
<li>The content contains a substring from amongst the following set: &hellip;</li>
<li>The content does not contain a substring from amongst the following set: &hellip;</li>
<li>The hash of the content exists amongst the following set of hashes: &hellip;</li>
<li>The hash of the content does not exist amongst the following set of hashes: &hellip;</li>
<li>The content was matched by a machine-learning classifier with the following training set: &hellip;</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conversation-metadata">Conversation Metadata</h2>

<p>Examples of Conversation Metadata are given in the main text.</p>

<h2 id="non-pcasm">Non-PCASM</h2>

<p>Information which would not be PCASM would include, non-exclusively:</p>

<ol>
<li>The content is sent from Alice</li>
<li>The content is sent to Bob</li>
<li>The content is between 1 and 16 bytes long</li>
<li>The content was sent at the following date and time: &hellip;</li>
<li>The content was sent from the following IP address: &hellip;</li>
<li>The content was sent from the following geolocation: &hellip;</li>
<li>The content was composed using the following platform: &hellip;</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="worked-example">Worked Example</h1>

<p>Consider FooBook,
a hypothetical example company
which provides
messaging services
for conversations
between entities
who use it.</p>

<p>For each conversation
FooBook <strong>MUST</strong> decide
whether to represent itself
as a conversation participant
or as a non-participant. (Transparency of Participation)</p>

<p>If FooBook decides
to represent itself
as a non-participant,
then it <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
have any access to PCASM. (Integrity of Participation / Non-Participation)</p>

<p>If FooBook decides
to represent itself
as a participant,
then it <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
have exceptional access
to PCASM,
despite being
the provider
of the service -
for instance
via
raw database access
or network sniffing.
However it <strong>MAY</strong>
participate in
E2ESM conversations
in a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; way,
and thereby
have &ldquo;normal&rdquo; access
to intra-conversation PCASM.
(Integrity of Participation, Equality of Participation)</p>

<p>FooBook <strong>MAY</strong>
retain means
to eject reported abusive participants
from a conversation. (Decrease in Closure of Participation)</p>

<p>FooBook <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
retain means
to forcibly insert
new participants
into a conversation.
For clarity:
this specification
does not recognise
any notion
of &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; exchange
of one participant with another,
treating it as an ejection,
followed by an &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; insertion.
(Increase in Closure of Participation)</p>

<p>FooBook <strong>MUST</strong>
enable the user
to observe and manage
the complete state
of their <cite class="informative"><a href="#TrustedComputingBase"><sup>[TrustedComputingBase]</sup></a></cite>
with respect
to their FooBook messaging services. (Management and Visibility)</p>

<p>FooBook <strong>MAY</strong>
treat conversation metadata
as PCASM,
but it <strong>MUST</strong>
communicate to participants
whether it does,
or does not.</p>
