<p>This document
defines End-to-End Secure Messaging
in terms of the behaviours
that <strong>MUST</strong> be exhibited
by software
which claims to implement it,
or which claims to implement
that subset which is known as
End-to-End Encrypted Messaging.</p>
<section data-matter="main">
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>End-to-End Secure Messaging (E2ESM)
is a mechanism
which offers a digital analogue
of &ldquo;closed distribution lists&rdquo;
for sharing message content
amongst a set of participants,
where all participants
are visible to each other
and where non-participants
are excluded
from access to message content.</p>

<p>In client-server network models
it is common to implement E2ESM
by means of encryption,
in order to obscure
content at rest
upon a central server.
So therefore E2ESM
is often
narrowly regarded
in terms of &ldquo;end-to-end encryption&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Other architectural approaches exist -
for instance <cite class="informative"><a href="#RicochetRefresh"><sup>[RicochetRefresh]</sup></a></cite>
which implements
closed distribution
by using
secure point-to-point <cite class="informative"><a href="#RFC7686"><sup>[RFC7686]</sup></a></cite> networking
to literally restrict
the distribution
of plaintext content
to relevant participants.</p>

<p>Therefore we describe E2ESM
in terms of
functional outcomes
of the messenger
rather than
in terms
of implementation
goals and technologies.</p>

<h2 id="notational-conventions">Notational Conventions</h2>

<p>The key words &ldquo;MUST&rdquo;, &ldquo;MUST NOT&rdquo;, &ldquo;REQUIRED&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHALL&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHALL NOT&rdquo;,
&ldquo;SHOULD&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHOULD NOT&rdquo;, &ldquo;RECOMMENDED&rdquo;, &ldquo;NOT RECOMMENDED&rdquo;, &ldquo;MAY&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;OPTIONAL&rdquo; in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
14 <cite class="informative"><a href="#RFC2119"><sup>[RFC2119]</sup></a></cite> <cite class="informative"><a href="#RFC8174"><sup>[RFC8174]</sup></a></cite> when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.</p>

<h1 id="requirements-for-an-end-to-end-secure-messenger">Requirements for an End-to-End Secure Messenger</h1>

<p>Software which functions
as an End-to-End Secure Messenger
<strong>MUST</strong> satisfy the following principles, and
<strong>MUST</strong> satisfy these principles in respect of the provided definitions
for all forms of communication
and data-sharing
that the software offers,
otherwise it is not
an End-to-End Secure Messenger.</p>

<h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>

<p>For a series of
one or more &ldquo;messages&rdquo;
each which are composed
of &ldquo;plaintext content and sensitive metadata&rdquo; (PCASM)
and which constitute
a &ldquo;conversation&rdquo;
amongst a set of &ldquo;participants&rdquo;,
to provide E2ESM
will require:</p>

<h2 id="equality-of-participation">Equality of Participation</h2>

<p>All participants
<strong>MUST</strong> be peers who
<strong>MUST</strong> have equal access
to any given message&rsquo;s PCASM.</p>

<h2 id="transparency-of-participation">Transparency of Participation</h2>

<p>The existence
of all current
conversation participants
<strong>MUST</strong> be visible
at all times
to all current
conversation participants.</p>

<h2 id="integrity-of-participation">Integrity of Participation</h2>

<p>The PCASM
of any given message
<strong>MUST</strong> only be available
to the fixed set
of conversation participants
from whom,
to whom,
and at the time when
it was sent.</p>

<h3 id="non-participation">Non-Participation</h3>

<p>It follows that
for any given message,
all entities
that exist
outside of
the above-defined set
are &ldquo;non-participants&rdquo;
in respect of that message.</p>

<h2 id="closure-of-conversation">Closure of Conversation</h2>

<p>The set of participants
in a conversation
<strong>SHALL NOT</strong> be increased
except by the intentional action
of one or more
existing participants.</p>

<h2 id="management-and-visibility-of-participant-clients-devices">Management and Visibility of Participant Clients &amp; Devices</h2>

<p>E2ESM solutions
<strong>MUST</strong> provide
each participant entity
with means
to review or revoke access for
clients or devices
that can access
future PCASM.</p>

<p>E2ESM solutions
<strong>MUST</strong> provide
each participant entity
with notifications
or complete logs
of changes
to the set of
clients or devices
that can or could access
message PCASM.</p>

<h1 id="definitions">Definitions</h1>

<p>These principles
<strong>MUST</strong> be measured
with respect to
the following definitions:</p>

<h2 id="participant">Participant</h2>

<p>A participant
is any entity -
human, machine, software bot, escrow agent, or otherwise,
that is bounded
by the extent
of that entity&rsquo;s
<cite class="informative"><a href="#TrustedComputingBase"><sup>[TrustedComputingBase]</sup></a></cite>.</p>

<h2 id="conversation">Conversation</h2>

<p>A conversation
is a sequence
of one or more messages
over a period of time
amongst a constant or evolving
set of participants.</p>

<h2 id="plaintext-content-and-sensitive-metadata-pcasm">Plaintext Content and Sensitive Metadata (PCASM)</h2>

<p>The PCASM
of a message
is defined as:
1 or more
bits of information
regarding any or all of:</p>

<ol>
<li>the plaintext message content (the &ldquo;content&rdquo;)</li>
<li>the precise size of the content</li>
<li>any metadata which may describe the thematic nature of the content</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="examples-of-pcasm">Examples of PCASM</h3>

<p>Information which would be PCASM would include, non-exclusively:</p>

<ol>
<li>The content is &ldquo;Hello, world.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The content is definitely 13 bytes long</li>
<li>The content starts with the word &ldquo;Hello&rdquo;</li>
<li>The content contains the substring &ldquo;ello&rdquo;</li>
<li>The content does not contain the word &ldquo;Goodbye&rdquo;</li>
<li>The content contains a substring from amongst the following set: &hellip;</li>
<li>The content does not contain a substring from amongst the following set: &hellip;</li>
<li>The top bit of the first byte of the content in ASCII encoding, is zero</li>
<li>The MD5 hash of the content is 080aef839b95facf73ec599375e92d47</li>
<li>The hash of the content exists amongst the following set of hashes: &hellip;</li>
<li>The hash of the content does not exist amongst the following set of hashes: &hellip;</li>
<li>The content was matched by a machine-learning classifier with the following training set: &hellip;</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="examples-of-non-pcasm">Examples of non-PCASM</h3>

<p>Information which would not be PCASM would include, non-exclusively:</p>

<ol>
<li>The content is sent from Alice</li>
<li>The content is sent to Bob</li>
<li>The content is between 1 and 16 bytes long</li>
<li>The content was sent at the following date and time: &hellip;</li>
<li>The content was sent from the following IP address: &hellip;</li>
<li>The content was sent from the following geolocation: &hellip;</li>
<li>The content was composed using the following platform: &hellip;</li>
</ol>

<p>There is obvious discussion
to be had
regarding
&ldquo;how fuzzy a content-size is fuzzy enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the size of a message&rsquo;s content
is at all observable
by a non-participant,
it would appear reasonable
where a block cipher is used to implement E2ESM,
to avoid visibly surfacing
the underlying content size
as a number
that is any more specific or precise
than an integer multiple
of the underlying cipher block size would be.</p>

<p>Stream cipher &ldquo;fuzziness&rdquo; adequacy
is currently undefined in this draft.</p>

<h2 id="backdoor">Backdoor</h2>

<p>Discussions of E2ESM
frequently reference
the concept of &ldquo;backdoors&rdquo;.
We propose a standard definition:</p>

<p>A backdoor
is any
intentional or unintentional mechanism,
in respect of a given message
and that message&rsquo;s set of participants
where some PCASM
of that message
<strong>MAY</strong> become available
to a non-participant
without the intentional action of a participant.</p>

<h1 id="scope-of-a-participant-in-e2esm">Scope of a Participant in E2ESM</h1>

<p>The term &ldquo;participant&rdquo;
in this document
exists to supercede
the more vague notion of &ldquo;end&rdquo;
in the phrase &ldquo;end-to-end&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Participants are defined
in terms of an entity&rsquo;s <cite class="informative"><a href="#TrustedComputingBase"><sup>[TrustedComputingBase]</sup></a></cite>
to acknowledge
that an entity
<strong>MAY</strong> legitimately
store, forward, or access messages
by means
that are outside of
the messenger software.</p>

<p>For example:
if a participant
accesses their E2ESM messenger
via remote desktop software,
and their RDP session is hijacked by a third party;
of if they back-up their messages
in cleartext
to cloud storage
leading somehow to data exfiltration,
neither of these
would be a failure of E2ESM.</p>

<p>This would be
a failure of
the participant&rsquo;s
<cite class="informative"><a href="#TrustedComputingBase"><sup>[TrustedComputingBase]</sup></a></cite>.</p>

<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>

<h1 id="worked-example">Worked Example</h1>

<p>Consider FooBook,
a hypothetical example company
which provides
messaging services
for conversations
between entities
who use it.</p>

<p>For each conversation
FooBook <strong>MUST</strong> decide
whether to represent itself
as a conversation participant
or as a non-participant. (Transparency of Participation)</p>

<p>If FooBook decides
to represent itself
as a non-participant,
then it <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
have any access to PCASM. (Integrity of Participation / Non-Participation)</p>

<p>If FooBook decides
to represent itself
as a participant,
then it <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
have privileged access
to PCASM,
for instance
via direct database access,
but it <strong>MAY</strong>
have &ldquo;normal&rdquo; access
to PCASM
of conversations
where it is a participant. (Integrity of Participation, Equality of Participation)</p>

<p>FooBook <strong>MAY</strong>
retain means
to eject reported abusive participants
from a conversation. (Decrease in Closure of Participation)</p>

<p>FooBook <strong>MUST NOT</strong>
retain means
to forcibly insert
new participants
into a conversation.
For clarity:
this specification
does not recognise
any notion
of &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; exchange
of one particpant with another,
treating it as an ejection,
followed by an &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; insertion.
(Increase in Closure of Participation)</p>

<p>FooBook <strong>MUST</strong>
enable the user
to observe and manage
the complete state
of their <cite class="informative"><a href="#TrustedComputingBase"><sup>[TrustedComputingBase]</sup></a></cite>
with respect
to their FooBook messaging services. (Management and Visibility)</p>

<h2 id="is-it-not-necessary-for-e2esm-to-offer-digital-rights-management">Is it not necessary for E2ESM to offer Digital Rights Management</h2>

<p>Integrity of Participation,
which restricts access
of a message&rsquo;s PCASM
to its fixed set of participants,
obviously does not apply
to content
that is copied
by one of its participants
as a &ldquo;fresh string of bits&rdquo;
that is sent
as a new message
to &ldquo;new, current&rdquo; participants.</p>

<p>Less obviously
an E2ESM solution
<strong>MAY</strong> enable
message &ldquo;forwarding&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;replying&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;quoting&rdquo;,
where a message&rsquo;s participant
may freshly send
the message&rsquo;s object references and keys
to enable
&ldquo;new, current&rdquo; participants
to access PCASM
from which
they were previously excluded.</p>

<p>Per the definition
of &ldquo;backdoor&rdquo;
this latter is considered
application functionality
requiring &ldquo;intentional action&rdquo;
of a message&rsquo;s participant -
nearly equivalent to
forwarding the content
as a &ldquo;fresh string of bits&rdquo;,
although potentially with greater attribution.</p>

<p>Both approaches -
analogous to &ldquo;call by value&rdquo;
versus &ldquo;call by reference&rdquo; -
raise interesting
application design questions.
However
such features
exist outside
of the scope
of this definition.</p>
