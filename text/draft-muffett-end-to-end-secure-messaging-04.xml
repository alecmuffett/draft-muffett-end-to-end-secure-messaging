<abstract>
<t>This draft
describes a test
which <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used
to falsify claims that
a messaging
or messenger application,
platform,
solution,
or service (&quot;messaging solution&quot;)
provides
either or both of
&quot;end-to-end security&quot;
or
&quot;end-to-end encryption&quot;.
(either/both: &quot;E2E&quot;)</t>
<t>Any
messaging solution,
or clearly defined
subset thereof,
which claims to
provide E2E,
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
satisfy
this test;
however
satisfaction of
this test
is not
wholly sufficient
to determine that
the messaging solution
actually provides E2E.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>&quot;End-to-end security&quot; and
&quot;end-to-end encryption&quot;
offer digital analogues
of &quot;closed distribution lists&quot;
for sharing content
amongst a set of participants,
where non-participants
are fully excluded
from access to content.</t>
<t>This draft
assumes
a specific
application of
&quot;end-to-end security&quot;
or
&quot;end-to-end encryption&quot;
towards the
specific use case
of individual and group
messaging solutions
where participants
who are later added
to a messaging group
<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
be able
to access
previously-sent content.</t>
<t>In turn,
use cases
for such
messaging solutions
include
the sending
and receiving
of any
or all of:</t>

<ol>
<li>UNICODE or ASCII messages</li>
<li>images, video files or audio files</li>
<li>one-way streaming video or audio</li>
<li>two-way streaming video or audio, as in live calls</li>
</ol>
<t>The application
of this test
does not
depend upon
whether the
messaging solution
is built upon a
centralized,
distributed,
hybrid,
or any other
network model.</t>

retrospective access

<t>This echoes

a &quot;maillist&quot;

<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> render this moot.</t>
<t>For example

named &quot;blockchain-fans@example.com&quot;
would leak
its implicit topic

</section>

<section anchor="why-entity-and-participant"><name>Why: Entity and Participant</name>
<t>The term &quot;participant&quot;
in this document
exists to supersede
the more vague notion of &quot;end&quot;
in the phrase &quot;end-to-end&quot;.</t>
<t>Entities,
and thus participants,
are defined
in terms of their <xref target="TrustedComputingBase"></xref>
to acknowledge
that an entity
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> legitimately
store, forward, or access messages
by means
that are outside of
the E2ESM software.</t>
<t>It is important to note
that the concept of &quot;entity&quot;
as defined by their TCB,
is the foundation
for all other trust in E2ESM.
This develops from
the basic definitions of
a <xref target="TrustedComputingBase"></xref>
and from the concepts of
&quot;trust-to-trust&quot; discussed in <xref target="RoleOfTrust"></xref>.
Failure of a participant
to maintain integrity or control
over their TCB
should not be considered
a failure of an E2ESM
that connects it to other participants.</t>
<t>For example:
if a participant
accesses their E2ESM software
via remote desktop software,
and their RDP session is hijacked by a third party;
of if they back-up their messages
in cleartext
to cloud storage
leading somehow to data exfiltration,
neither of these
would be a failure of E2ESM.
This would instead
be a failure
of the participant's
<xref target="TrustedComputingBase"></xref>.</t>
<t>Further:
it would be
obviously possible
to burden
an E2ESM
with surfacing
potential integrity issues
of any given participant
to other participants,
e.g. &quot;patch compliance&quot;.
But to require such
in this standard
would risk harming
the privacy
of the participant entity.

</section>

<section anchor="why-backdoor"><name>Why: Backdoor</name>
<t>In software engineering
there is a perpetual tension
between the concepts of
&quot;feature&quot; versus &quot;bug&quot; -
and occasionally
&quot;misfeature&quot; versus &quot;misbug&quot;.
These tensions
arise from
the problem of <xref target="DualUse"></xref> -
that it is
not feasible
to firmly
and completely
ascribe &quot;intention&quot;
to any hardware or software mechanism.</t>
<t>The information security community
has experienced
a historical spectrum
of mechanisms
which have assisted
non-participant access to PCASM.
These have
variously been named as
&quot;export-grade key restrictions&quot; (<xref target="ExportControl"></xref>, then <xref target="Logjam"></xref>),
&quot;side channel attacks&quot; (<xref target="Spectre"></xref> and <xref target="Meltdown"></xref>),
&quot;law enforcement access fields&quot; <xref target="Clipper"></xref>, and
&quot;key escrow&quot; <xref target="CryptoWars"></xref>.</t>
<t>All of
these terms
combine
an &quot;access facilitation mechanism&quot;
with an &quot;intention or opportunity&quot; -
and for all of them
an access facilitation mechanism
is first <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>.</t>
<t>An access facilitation mechanism
is a &quot;door&quot;,
and is inherently <xref target="DualUse"></xref>.
Because the goal
of E2ESM
is to limit
access to PCASM
exclusively to
a defined set of participants,
then the intended
means of access
is clearly the &quot;front door&quot;;
and any other access mechanism
is a &quot;back door&quot;.</t>
<t>If the term
&quot;back door&quot;
is considered
innately pejorative,
alternative, uncertain constructions
such as
&quot;illegitimate access feature&quot;,
&quot;potentially intentional data-access weakness&quot;,
&quot;legally-obligated exceptional access mechanism&quot;,
or any other phrase,
all <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> combine
both notions
of an access mechanism (e.g. &quot;door&quot;)
and a definite or suspected intention (e.g. &quot;legal obligation&quot;).</t>
<t>So the phrase
&quot;back door&quot;
is brief,
clear,
and widely understood
to mean &quot;a secondary means of access&quot;.
In the above definition
we already allow
for the term to be prefixed
with &quot;intentional&quot; or &quot;unintentional&quot;.</t>
<t>Thus it seems
appropriate
to use this term
in this context,
not least because
it is also not far removed
from the similar
and established term
&quot;side channel&quot;.</t>

at the time the message was composed.</t>
<t>If this was not the intention
we would deduce
that an E2ESM
would automatically make
past content
available to
newly-added conversation participants,
thereby breaking
forward secrecy.
This is not
a characteristic
of any E2ESM,
but it is
characteristic of
several non-E2ESM.
Therefore
the converse
is true.</t>
<t>As a concrete example
this means
that participants
who are
newly added
to a &quot;group&quot;
<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
be able
to read messages
that were
sent before
they joined
that group -
unless
(for instance)
one pre-existing participant
is explicitly intended
to provide
a &quot;searchable archive&quot;
or similar function.
The function
of such a participant
is considered to be
out of scope
for the messenger.</t>

<section anchor="why-equality-of-participation"><name>Why: Equality of Participation</name>
<t>Without equality of participation
it would be allowed
for a person to deploy
a standalone cleartext chat server,
available solely over TLS-encrypted links,
declare themselves to be &quot;participants&quot;
in every conversation from its outset,
access all message PCASM on that basis,
and yet call themselves an E2ESM.</t>
<t>So this is an &quot;anti-cheating&quot; clause:
all participant access to PCASM
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be via
the same mechanisms
for all participants
without favour or privilege,
and in particular
PCASM <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
be available via other means,
e.g.
raw block-device access,
raw filestore,
raw database access,
or network sniffing.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="why-closure-of-conversation"><name>Why: Closure of Conversation</name>
<t>If a conversation
is not
&quot;only extensible from within&quot;
then it would be possible
for participants
to be injected
into the conversation
thereby defeating
the closure of message distribution.</t>
<t>A subtle
centralised vs: decentralised
edge-case is as follows:
consider a
PGP-encrypted email distribution list.
Would it break &quot;closure of conversation&quot;
for a non-participant
email administrator
to simply add new users
to the maillist?</t>
<t>Answer: no, because
in this case
the maillist
is functioning
as a &quot;platform&quot;
for multiple &quot;conversation&quot; threads,
and mere addition of
of a new
&quot;transport-level&quot;
maillist member
would not include them
as a participant
in ongoing E2ESM conversations;
such inclusion
would be a future burden
upon existing participants.</t>
<t>However:
similar external injection
of a new entity
into a centralised
WhatsApp or Signal &quot;group&quot;
would be clearly a breach
of &quot;closure of conversation&quot;.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="why-management-of-participant-clients-and-devices"><name>Why: Management of Participant Clients and Devices</name>
<t>There is little benefit
in requiring
conversations
to be closed
against &quot;participant injection&quot;
if a non-participant
may obtain
PCASM access
by forcing a platform
to silently add
extra means of PCASM access
to an existing participant
on behalf of that non-participant.</t>
<t>Therefore
to be an E2ESM
the platform
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> provide
the described
management of participant clients and devices.</t>

<section anchor="disappearing-messages"><name>Disappearing Messages</name>
<t>&quot;Disappearing&quot;,
&quot;expiring&quot;,
&quot;exploding&quot;,
&quot;ephemeral&quot;
or other forms of
time-limited access to PCASM
are strongly <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>
but not obligatory
mechanisms
for E2ESM,
not least
because they
are impossible to implement
in a way that cannot be circumvented
by e.g. screenshots.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="mutual-identity-verification"><name>Mutual Identity Verification</name>
<t>Some manner of
&quot;shared key&quot;
which mutually assures
participant identity
and communications integrity
are strongly <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>
but not obligatory
mechanisms
for E2ESM.</t>
<t>The benefits
of such mechanisms
are limited to certain perspectives
of certain platforms.</t>
<t>For instance:
in Ricochet
the identity key
of a user
is the absolute source of truth
for their identity,
and excusing detection of typographic errors
there is nothing which can be added to that
in order to further assure their &quot;identity&quot;.</t>
<t>Similarly WhatsApp
provides each participant
with a &quot;verifiable security QR code&quot;
and &quot;security code change notifications&quot;,
but these codes
do not &quot;leak&quot; the number
of &quot;WhatsApp For Web&quot; connections,
desktop WhatsApp applications,
or other clients
which are bound to
the E2ESM software
which executes on that phone.</t>
<t>Participant-client information
of this kind
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be
a highly private aspect
of that participant's TCB,
and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be treated
sensitively by platforms.</t>

<t>Consider FooBook,
a hypothetical example company
which provides
messaging services
for conversations
between entities
who use it.</t>
<t>For each conversation
FooBook <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> decide
whether to represent itself
as a conversation participant
or as a non-participant. (Transparency of Participation)</t>
<t>If FooBook decides
to represent itself

then it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>

<t>If FooBook decides
to represent itself
as a participant,
then it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
have &quot;exceptional&quot; access
to PCASM,
despite being
the provider
of the service -
for instance
via
raw database access
or network sniffing.
However it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
participate in
E2ESM conversations
in a &quot;normal&quot; way,
and thereby
have &quot;normal&quot; access
to intra-conversation PCASM.
(Integrity of Participation, Equality of Participation)</t>
<t>FooBook <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>

For clarity:
this specification
