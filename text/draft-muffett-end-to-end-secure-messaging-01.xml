<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>End-to-End Secure Messaging (E2ESM)
is a mechanism
which offers a digital analogue
of &quot;closed distribution lists&quot;
for sharing message content
amongst a set of participants,
where all participants
are visible to each other
and where non-participants
are excluded
from access to message content.</t>
<t>In client-server network models
it is common to implement E2ESM
by means of encryption,
in order to obscure
content at rest
upon a central server.
So therefore E2ESM
is often
narrowly regarded
in terms of &quot;end-to-end encryption&quot;.</t>
<t>Other architectural approaches exist -
for instance <xref target="RicochetRefresh"></xref>
which implements
closed distribution
by using
secure point-to-point <xref target="RFC7686"></xref> networking
to literally restrict
the distribution
of plaintext content
to relevant participants.</t>
<t>Therefore we describe E2ESM
in terms of
functional behaviours
of the software
rather than
in terms
of implementation
goals and technologies.</t>

<section anchor="requirements-for-an-end-to-end-secure-messenger"><name>Requirements for an End-to-End Secure Messenger</name>
<t>Software which functions
as an
End-to-End Secure Messenger
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> satisfy the following principles, and
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> satisfy these principles in respect of the provided definitions
for all forms of communication
and data-sharing
that the software offers.
The software
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> comprise
either a complete application,
or a clearly defined subset
of functionality
within a
larger application.</t>
<t>Any software
that does not
satisfy these requirements
is not an
End-to-End Secure Messenger,
and it does not implement
End-to-End Secure Messaging,
nor does it implement
End-to-End Encrypted Messaging.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="principles"><name>Principles</name>
<t>For a series of
one or more &quot;messages&quot;
each which are composed
of &quot;plaintext content and sensitive metadata&quot; (PCASM)
and which constitute
a &quot;conversation&quot;
amongst a set of &quot;participants&quot;,
to provide E2ESM
will require:</t>

<section anchor="equality-of-participation"><name>Equality of Participation</name>
<t>All participants
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be peers who
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have equal access
to any given message's PCASM.</t>

<section anchor="why-do-we-need-this"><name>Why do we need this?</name>
<t>Without equality of participation
it would be allowed
for a person to deploy
a standalone cleartext chat server,
available solely over TLS-encrypted links,
declare themselves to be &quot;participants&quot;
in every conversation from its outset,
access all message PCASM on that basis,
and yet call themselves an E2ESM.</t>
<t>So this is an &quot;anti-cheating&quot; clause:
all participant access to PCASM
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be via
the same mechanisms
for all participants
without favour or privilege,
and in particular
PCASM <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
be available via other means,
e.g.
raw filestore,
database access
or network sniffing.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="transparency-of-participation"><name>Transparency of Participation</name>
<t>The existence
of all current
conversation participants
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be visible
at the current
time
to all current
conversation participants.</t>

<section anchor="why-do-we-need-this-1"><name>Why do we need this?</name>
<t>The &quot;ends&quot; of &quot;end to end&quot; are the participants;
for a message to be composed
to be exclusively accessible
to that set of participants,
all participants must be visible.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="integrity-of-participation"><name>Integrity of Participation</name>
<t>Excusing the
&quot;retransmission exception&quot;,
PCASM
of any given message
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only be available
to the fixed set
of conversation participants
from whom,
to whom,
and at the time when
it was sent.</t>

<section anchor="retransmission-exception"><name>Retransmission Exception</name>
<t>If a participant
that can access
an &quot;original&quot; message
intentionally &quot;retransmits&quot;
(e.g. quotes, forwards)
that message
to create
a new message
within the E2ESM software,
then
the original message's PCASM
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
become available
to a new,
additional,
and
possibly different
set of
conversation participants,
via that new message.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="non-participation"><name>Non-Participation</name>
<t>It follows that
for any given message,
all entities
that exist
outside of
the above-defined sets of participants
will be &quot;non-participants&quot;
in respect of that message.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="why-do-we-need-this-2"><name>Why do we need this?</name>
<t>Inherent in the term
&quot;end to end secure messenger&quot;
is the intention
that PCASM
will only be available
to the participants (&quot;ends&quot;)
at the time the message was composed.</t>
<t>If this was not the intention
we would deduce
that an E2ESM
would automatically make
past content
available to
newly-added conversation participants,
thereby breaking
forward secrecy.
This is not
a characteristic
of any E2ESM,
but it is
characteristic of
several non-E2ESM.
Therefore
the converse
is true.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="closure-of-conversation"><name>Closure of Conversation</name>
<t>The set of participants
in a conversation
<bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14> be increased
except by the intentional action
of one or more
existing participants.</t>

<section anchor="public-conversations-and-self-subscription"><name>Public Conversations and Self-Subscription</name>
<t>Existing participants <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
publicly share
links,
data,
or other mechanisms
to enable
non-participant entities
to subscribe themselves
as conversation participants.
This <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be
considered
legitimate
&quot;intentional action&quot;
to increase the set of participants
in the group.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="why-do-we-need-this-3"><name>Why do we need this?</name>
<t>If a conversation
is not &quot;only extensible from within&quot;
then it would be possible
for participants
to be injected
into the conversation
thereby defeating
the closure of message distribution.</t>

<t>Where there
exists
centralised

<section anchor="definitions"><name>Definitions</name>
<t>These principles
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be measured
with respect to
the following definitions:</t>

<section anchor="participant"><name>Participant</name>
<t>A participant
is any entity -
human,
machine,
software bot,
conversation archiver,
or other,
that is bounded
by the extent
of that entity's
Trusted Computing Base (TCB).</t>
<t>It is important to note
that the concept of &quot;participant&quot;,
defined by their TCB,
is a foundation for all other trust.
Developing from
the basic definitions of
a  <xref target="TrustedComputingBase"></xref>
and from the concept of
&quot;trust-to-trust&quot; discussed in <xref target="RoleOfTrust"></xref>,
a failure of a participant
to maintain integrity
over their own (trusted) environment
should not be considered
a failure of an E2ESM
that connects it to other participants.</t>
<t>Further: it is
obviously possible
to burden
the E2ESM
with surfacing
potential integrity issues
of any given participant;
but to require such
in this standard
would risk harming
the privacy
of the participant entity.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="conversation"><name>Conversation</name>
<t>A conversation
is a sequence

over a period of time
amongst a constant or evolving

<section anchor="content-pcasm"><name>Content PCASM</name>
<t>Content PCASM
is any data

per-conversation
&quot;group&quot; metadata,
such as
&quot;group titles&quot;,
&quot;group topics&quot;,
&quot;group icons&quot;,
or &quot;group participant lists&quot;
constitute PCASM,
is an

choice
for E2ESM software,
but that choice
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
be made apparent
to participants.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="backdoor"><name>Backdoor</name>
<t>A &quot;backdoor&quot;
is any
intentional or unintentional mechanism,
in respect of a given message
and that message's set of participants,
where some PCASM
of that message
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> become available
to a non-participant
without the intentional action of a participant.</t>

<section anchor="why-call-this-a-backdoor"><name>Why call this a &quot;backdoor&quot;?</name>
<t>In software engineering
there is a perpetual tension
between the concepts of
&quot;feature&quot; versus &quot;bug&quot; -
and occasionally
&quot;misfeature&quot; versus &quot;misbug&quot;.
These tensions
arise from
the problem of <xref target="DualUse"></xref> -
that it is
not feasible
to firmly
and completely
ascribe &quot;intention&quot;
to any hardware or software mechanism.</t>
<t>The information security community
have experienced
a historical spectrum
of mechanisms
which have assisted
non-participant access to PCASM.
These have
variously been named as
&quot;export-grade key restrictions&quot; (TLS, then Logjam),
&quot;side channel attacks&quot; (Spectre and Meltdown),
&quot;law enforcement access fields&quot; (Clipper), and
&quot;key escrow&quot; (Crypto Wars).</t>
<t>All of
these terms
combine
an &quot;access facilitation mechanism&quot;
with an &quot;intention or opportunity&quot; -
and for all of them
an access facilitation mechanism
is first <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>.</t>
<t>An access facilitation mechanism
is a &quot;door&quot;,
and is inherently <xref target="DualUse"></xref>.
Because the goal
of E2ESM
is to limit
access to PCASM
exclusively to
a defined set of participants,
then the intended
means of access
is clearly the &quot;front door&quot;;
and any other access mechanism
is a &quot;back door&quot;.</t>
<t>If the term
&quot;back door&quot;
is considered
innately pejorative,
alternative, uncertain constructions
such as
&quot;illegitimate access feature&quot;,
&quot;potentially intentional data-access weakness&quot;,
&quot;legally-obligated exceptional access mechanism&quot;,
or any other phrase,
all <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> combine
both notions
of an access mechanism (e.g. &quot;door&quot;)
and a definite or suspected intention (e.g. &quot;legal obligation&quot;).</t>
<t>So the phrase
&quot;back door&quot;
is brief,
clear,
and widely understood
to mean &quot;a secondary means of access&quot;.
In the above definition
we already allow
for the term to be prefixed
with &quot;intentional&quot; or &quot;unintentional&quot;.</t>
<t>Thus it seems
appropriate
to use this term
in this context,
not least because
it is also not far removed
from the similar
and established term
&quot;side channel&quot;.</t>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="scope-of-a-participant-in-e2esm"><name>Scope of a Participant in E2ESM</name>
<t>The term &quot;participant&quot;
in this document
exists to supersede
the more vague notion of &quot;end&quot;
in the phrase &quot;end-to-end&quot;.</t>
<t>Participants are defined
in terms of an entity's <xref target="TrustedComputingBase"></xref>
to acknowledge
that an entity
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> legitimately
store, forward, or access messages
by means
that are outside of
the E2ESM software.</t>
<t>For example:
if a participant
accesses their E2ESM software
via remote desktop software,
and their RDP session is hijacked by a third party;
of if they back-up their messages
in cleartext
to cloud storage
leading somehow to data exfiltration,
neither of these
would be a failure of E2ESM.
This would instead
be a failure
of the participant's
<xref target="TrustedComputingBase"></xref>.</t>

However it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
